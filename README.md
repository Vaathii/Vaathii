# üí´ About Me:
Hey there! I'm **SivaShankar A V** (aka **Shiva**).
I'm a BCA student at Amrita AHEAD, a self-taught dev, and someone who vibes best with rain, good code, and meaningful tech.

üåßÔ∏è Currently building **Rainly Studios**, an umbrella startup inspired by Google, while honing [shankar.fun](https://shankar.fun).
Rainly Studios aims to house multiple tools and creative projects under one roof‚Äîfrom open source utilities to small SaaS ideas.
My goal is to learn by doing and share that knowledge with the community.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring for local foods, teaching others, or chasing the perfect rainy playlist.
